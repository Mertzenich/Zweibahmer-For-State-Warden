He is a family man, married for 30 years to his wife Teresa. They have four children and four grandchildren so they know the importance of faith in the family.  He has served as Extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist at his Parish, St. Francis DeSales, and in the Ossian Senior Hospice. He also believes that Iowa is always a contender for the Circle of Honor. <font color="red">He knows how to get it done. In fact, he has done it! John is one of seven Membership Directors that has achieved it and he plans to continue pushing the success in the growth and outreach of our jurisdiction as a State Officer.</font></b></p>

									<h3>About John</h3>
									<p>John been a Knight since 2008 and just a year later, he became Grand Knight of his Council, a position that he held for the next 7 years until 2016.  In 2012-2013 he led the Council to achieve its first Star Council Award in about 9 years. The Council achieved this through implementing new activities in the Council such as the Spelling Bee Contest, a Comedy Night, establishing an electronic phone tree for the council and a Council Newsletter.<br /><br />
                                    
                                    From 2013 to 2016 he served as District Warden and from 2015 to 2017 as District Deputy. After attending the Supreme Convention in Philadelphia in 2015 he brought ideas to his District and region to improve the fraternal activities and combining efforts to grow the membership and the outreach of the Knights in northeast Iowa. The Iowa delegation to the Supreme Convention encouraged John and supported him to run as a 3rd Degree Member of the Executive committee in which he served from 2017 to 2019. He was then asked to become the Membership Director for the Iowa Jurisdiction, a position that he held for the same period and in which he led the membership team in Iowa to the Supreme Knight’s Circle of Honor.  Iowa had not been on the Circle of Honor since 2013-2014. Iowa was the only Division 2 jurisdiction to achieve such an honor and the second largest jurisdiction in the Order to receive such an honor.  Iowa closed the year with 104% of its goal, the largest in almost 10 years. John believes in the growth of Iowa’s membership and he knows how to work with Regional Chairmen, District Deputies and Grand Knights to motivate, encourage and promote the growth of the Order.<br /><br />
                                        
                                    John has also brought success to his local Assembly, where he currently serves as Faithful Navigator and has led the Davis Assembly 271 to earn its first ever Civic Award. He also serves as Assistant to the Master of the Fourth Degree in Iowa and is an active Honor guard participant.<br /><br />

									<h5>Saint Benedict's Council 4208: </h5>
                                    <blockquote>Saint Benedict's Council 4208 in Decorah strongly supports John Zweibahmer's candidacy for State Warden. John has been a blessing and a source of fraternal strength in northeast Iowa, not only as a District Deputy (DD), but also as a Faithful Navigator and as a strong brother Knight. John is engaged, active, and supportive, and we consider him a true friend and a model of Christian service. God has blessed John with a wonderful wife, Teresa, who will strongly support John in his desire to serve God through the Knights of Columbus here in Iowa; we love Teresa too! As an example of John's zeal for the Order, John was the first DD in the State of Iowa to set up a district banquet, which has been very well received. These banquets have featured information from Catholic and non-profit groups as well as fine food, engaging speeches and camaraderie. John loves God, the Church, and the Order of the Knights of Columbus.</blockquote>

                                    <blockquote>My name is Paul Rael and I am writing this letter of support on behalf of John Zweibahmer whom I have known since he was in high school. John is a very serious young man who have proven himself a leader time after time. John’s current position is state membership Director, a position he has held for the past two years. I would like to nominate John for the position of State Warden. I am confident that John will do an excellent job in this office as he is very active in the Knights of Columbus organization. Currently I am the Grand Knight for Council 2073 of the Ossian Knights of Columbus, anytime that I need a question answered or need help with anything, John is always ready to assist and give a helping hand. I do not know a better person than John for this office.</blockquote>
